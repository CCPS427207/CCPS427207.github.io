    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Personally, I am working towards being a more outgoing type of person but because of my personality, it's difficult. I'm also trying to build connections and get along with others as I get older. As for my professional life, I want to work towards a steady and healthy job. But, in the future, I am trying to work on something related to the mind and the way we think; psychology. I decided that a job related to psychology is what interests me most and it was something that I wanted to learn about since I was in 5th grade. It just always interests me how someone thinks and how their thinking process leads them to start or cause a situation. The way I am working towards these goals is by talking out more often than I usually do and trying to get acquainted with people those close to me know and somewhat trying to converse with them. For jobs suited for my age, I am trying to find a part-time job that I take interest in so that I can save up money for college and university. In the case of my future jobs, I am going to school to receive the necessary education that I need to get the type of jobs that I am aiming to get when I'm older. The values I consider significant for my success are responsibility, having the correct mindset, knowledge, consistency and etc. Having responsibility is important because it helps me go through my mistakes without feeling guilty or regretful. It also allows me to accept and admit my mistakes whether it be in my personal or professional life. Being in the correct mindset while working allows us to achieve greater things and helps us think more with a positive, optimistic view of things. Knowledge enables us to consider problems, themes, and difficulties from a variety of angles. We can also put what we know into practice and that can lead us to succeed. Finally, consistency is the dedication to your goals and staying on task with things and activities related to what your goals are. Some short-term goals that I wish to accomplish in the near future are being able to travel to different countries, states, and anywhere I haven't seen. I want to have the motivation to pick up a book and start reading again. Also, having the goal of being able to learn the beginning piano and any other instruments that pique my interest. When I am not around, I want people to talk about me to others as honest, loyal, friendly, trustworthy, clean, and dependable. As for achievements, I want to be known as someone who was able to re-organize something so that it could work better, developed a new system or procedure, and someone who came up with improved ideas. Being recognized and having these character traits and achievements can become building blocks in my life for when I start looking for somewhere to settle in terms of jobs.</p>
